## K-9 Mail is working on adding JMAP support 

15 November 2019 / JMAP Community

> JMAP is in constant evolution, it has a lot to offer, especially on mobile devices for which IMAP has not been designed. Since its creation, more and more solutions have already supported it or are considering integrating it as a protocol. This is the case of [K-9 Mail](https://k9mail.github.io/) which is an open source email client for Android with many advanced features. 

>This was first announced as a proposed idea on K-9 Mail's proposed ideas page for [application for the Google Summer of Code 2017](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2017#jmap).
Then, in September 2019, in a [comment](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/issues/3272#issuecomment-528326161), [Cketti](https://github.com/cketti) indicated a possible work on the JMAP support for 6 months from September.

> Moreover, through his [another comment](https://gitter.im/apache/james-project?at=5d766ca4c5939027203eb09d) of September 09, 2019, we can understand that the project is no longer in the proposed idea stage, but that he is already working on adding JMAP support to K-9 Mail.
> Find the list of [solutions](https://jmap.io/software.html) that already support JMAP and those that are already working on it.

## JMAP is on the home straight

27 December 2018 / Bron Gondwana

>In 2014, we talked about [JMAP](https://fastmail.blog/2014/12/23/jmap-a-better-way-to-email/).  , the open protocol for modern email, which was born out of the web interface we have since 2011. We believe in open standards, both as a contribution to the community through what we have learned and as a bulwark against the growth of walled gardens.
JMAP in 2014 was a first draft protocol and an idea. JMAP in 2018 is almost finished the standard process and has a solid use in the real world.
Let's look at what has happened in the last 4 years.

## Dec 23: The JMAP momentum builds

23 December 2015 / Neil Jenkins

> In our advent blog series last year [we announced JMAP](https://fastmail.blog/2014/12/23/jmap-a-better-way-to-email/), our effort to make a better standard for synchronising mail, calendars and contacts. Exactly one year on, we thought it would be good to give an update on our progress so far. Replacing ageing technology standards takes time, even when there are huge advantages over the previous generation, but we were delighted to see significant advancements this year. We've been talking with mailbox providers big and small, as well as server and client developers, to raise awareness and get people onboard. And already, the momentum is building.

11 August 2015 / Neil Jenkins

>Last December[ we announced the JMAP project ](https://fastmail.blog/2014/12/23/jmap-a-better-way-to-email/), our effort to develop a new open protocol for mail, calendar and contact clients that’s faster and more powerful than the current standards. Since then, we’ve continued to refine  [the specification](http://jmap.io/spec.html), and other companies have come on board to help build the future of email.  [Atmail](https://www.atmail.com/) is [using JMAP](https://www.atmail.com/blog/future-inbox) to power their next-generation mobile apps.
